# TO DO

- Handle fetch scripts, styles
- Checkbox not responding on false -- preventing update?
- Components
- Global func registry working?
- Common scaffolding
- Need to pass templ variables to function eval
- Registration not working on trans in for templ

- Double-check function parsing
- Fix transition spacer
- History API - set up map of states to reference on popstate / routing

- RETHINK function parsing scope -- maybe don't pass in args for stores and don't take input by default. Variables are looked up in stores, assumed to be a property, or a global var or function. Would need to do some AST parsing or something.
