# TO DO

- History API - set up map of states to reference on popstate / routing
- Checkbox not responding on false -- preventing update?
- Throbber support
- Supporting props: loop over observedAttributes and replace $:{} like in templs?

- Common scaffolding
- Fix transition spacer

- Double-check -- are store updates being called too often in templ? (check conditions - elseif seems to be called twice)
